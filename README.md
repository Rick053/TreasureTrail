# TreasureTrail
Treasure trail application using Cocoon
The idea is an app that enables you to play a treasure trail with a group of people, who you don’t necessarily know. At the beginning each player gets a hint. As soon as you come within range of another player, or the treasure, your phone will start vibrating. The closer you get the stronger the vibrations will become, giving the effect of the well known birthday game “hot or cold” to find your presents. As soon as you are close enough to your fellow player you will exchange your hints. This way you get a step closer to solving the treasure trail. 

The treasure trail always leads to a retail store. At the end of the treasure trail there will be a real treasure, for example a discount coupon for the store where the treasure was found. This way the customer really feels that he has earned something. Furthermore the user is probably going to stay in the store because of the coupon.
